#summary Aggregate Operators: Aggregate - Simple

== Aggregate Operators: Aggregate - Simple == 

This sample uses Aggregate to create a running product on the array that calculates the total product of all elements.

=== Code ===

{{{
public void Linq92() {
    double[] doubles = { 1.7, 2.3, 1.9, 4.1, 2.9 };

#summary Aggregate Operators: Aggregate - Seed

== Aggregate Operators: Aggregate - Seed == 

This sample uses Aggregate to create a running account balance that subtracts each withdrawal from the initial balance of 100, as long as the balance never drops below 0.

=== Code ===

{{{

#summary Join Operators: Left Outer Join

== Join Operators: Left Outer Join == 

A so-called outer join can be expressed with a group join. A left outer join is like a cross join, except that all the left hand side elements get included at least once, even if they don't match any right hand side elements. Note how Vegetables shows up in the output even though it has no matching products.

#summary Projection Operators: SelectMany - Compound from 3

== Projection Operators: SelectMany - Compound from 3 == 

This sample uses a compound from clause to select all orders where the order was made in 1998 or later.

=== Code ===

{{{
public void Linq16() {
    List<Customer> customers = GetCustomerList();

    var orders =
        from c in customers
        from o in c.Orders
        where o.OrderDate >= new DateTime(1998, 1, 1)
        select new {c.CustomerID, o.OrderID, o.OrderDate};

    ObjectDumper.Write(orders);
}

}}}

#summary Projection Operators: SelectMany - from Assignment

== Projection Operators: SelectMany - from Assignment == 

This sample uses a compound from clause to select all orders where the order total is greater than 2000.00 and uses from assignment to avoid requesting the total twice.

=== Code ===

== Projection Operators: SelectMany - Multiple from == 

This sample uses multiple from clauses so that filtering on customers can be done before selecting their orders.  This makes the query more efficient by not selecting and then discarding orders for customers outside of Washington.

=== Code ===

        from o in c.Orders

#summary Ordering Operators: ThenByDescending - Comparer

== Ordering Operators: ThenByDescending - Comparer == 

This sample uses an OrderBy and a ThenBy clause with a custom comparer to sort first by word length and then by a case-insensitive descending sort of the words in an array.

=== Code ===

{{{
public void Linq38() {
    string[] words = { "aPPLE", "AbAcUs", "bRaNcH", "BlUeBeRrY", "ClOvEr", "cHeRry"};

        words.OrderBy(a => a.Length)
             .ThenByDescending(a => a, new CaseInsensitiveComparer());
        
    ObjectDumper.Write(sortedWords);
}

public class CaseInsensitiveComparer : IComparer<string>
{
    public int Compare(string x, string y)
    {
        return string.Compare(x, y, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
    }
}
